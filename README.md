# Hello-world.exe 🌏   

Hi! I'm Ayrra 👋
I started my journey in graphic design, where I learned to combine creativity with clean, thoughtful execution. Now, I’m exploring the world of software development and currently working as a Junior System Developer.

I like building things that work well and look good.
Always learning. Always experimenting. 🚀
