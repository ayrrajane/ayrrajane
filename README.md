### About me 🤏 
Since 2016 I've been living and breathing different programming languages every morning   
and creating illustrations before sleeping.   

I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects,   
helping to make this world a little better through design & code.  

### What I'm focusing on
Currently improving my knowledge in programming: Java, C++, C#, Phyton
